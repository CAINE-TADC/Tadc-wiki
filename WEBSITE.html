    <!-- Character Sections -->
    <div class="character">
        <h2>Caine</h2>
        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/tadc/images/7/73/Caine_render.webp/revision/latest?cb=20240102041520" alt="Caine">
        <div class="character-description">
            <p>Caine is depicted as a nonsensical, over-the-top, vivacious ringleader. However, there is an aloofness about him and a significant disconnection towards the traumatic events that the characters around him are experiencing, illustrated by his forgetfulness of Zooble's criticisms of their own form and his adventures. Despite a penchant for deadly circus games, he is not outright evil, just obliviously mischievous.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="character">
        <h2>Pomni</h2>
        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/tadc/images/e/ec/MaxHQ_NoBlur_Pomni_Render.webp/revision/latest?cb=20240526142327" alt="Pomni">
        <div class="character-description">
            <p>Pomni is high-strung, timid, and often paranoid. She struggles to adjust to the Digital Circus, frequently displaying anxiety and paranoia. As she spends more time with the other characters, she becomes apathetic but gradually more compassionate, notably towards Gummigoo.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="character">
        <h2>Ragatha</h2>
        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/tadc/images/d/d7/RagathaRender.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20241010205007" alt="Ragatha">
        <div class="character-description">
            <p>Ragatha is an optimist who hides her vulnerability. She is often injured due to her doll form but tends to shrug off harm with humor. Her forgiving nature and resilience help her maintain stability, despite the Circus's chaotic environment.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="character">
        <h2>Zooble</h2>
        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/tadc/images/f/f0/Random.webp/revision/latest?cb=20240526190431" alt="Zooble">
        <div class="character-description">
            <p>Zooble is reserved and often critical of their own appearance, suggesting possible body dysmorphia. They prefer to keep interactions short and don't engage deeply in Caine's antics, though their criticism led to a notable existential moment for Caine.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="character">
        <h2>Jax</h2>
        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/tadc/images/8/82/Bunny.png/revision/latest?cb=20240324023458" alt="Jax">
        <div class="character-description">
            <p>Jax is mischievous and has a teasing, sometimes cruel streak, often at others' expense. His interactions with the other characters can border on mean-spirited, but his humor also provides levity to the otherwise tense environment.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="character">
        <h2>Gangle</h2>
        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/tadc/images/5/5e/Gangle.png/revision/latest?cb=20230707193024" alt="Gangle Comedy Mask">
        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/tadc/images/2/25/SadGangle.png/revision/latest?cb=20230711222538" alt="Gangle Tragedy Mask">
        <div class="character-description">
            <p>Gangle has two sides based on the mask she wears. The Comedy Mask reveals a reserved, calm side, while the Tragedy Mask exposes a tearful and unstable personality. Her fragility is both literal and emotional, making her highly sensitive to her environment.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="character">
        <h2>Kinger</h2>
        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/tadc/images/1/1d/King.png/revision/latest?cb=20231110220651" alt="Kinger">
        <div class="character-description">
            <p>Kinger is erratic and paranoid, often disconnected from reality due to his prolonged time in the Circus. Despite this, he has moments of bravery and wisdom, particularly in dark areas where he becomes a source of comfort for others.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="character">
        <h2>Kaufmo</h2>
        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/tadc/images/7/7f/Kaufmo_.png/revision/latest?cb=20231014191854" alt="Kaufmo Pre-Abstraction">

        <div class="character-description">
            <p>Kaufmo was once known for his jokes, although they were often poorly received by others. His obsession with finding an exit drove him to instability, leading to his eventual abstraction, as witnessed by Ragatha and Pomni.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="character">
        <h2>Bubble</h2>

        <div class="character-description">
            <p>Bubble is an eccentric, somewhat dim-witted character who constantly interrupts others. He is laid-back, often found being popped by Caine, and has a fondness for Angel Food Cake.</p>

    <div class="character">
        <h2>Gummigoo</h2>
        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/tadc/images/7/79/CandyCarrier17904.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20240504155342" alt="Gummigoo">
        <div class="character-description">
            <p>Gummigoo is strategic and skilled in complex plans, initially an antagonist who discovers his NPC identity, causing an existential crisis. Pomni's empathy helps him evolve, seeking redemption and understanding.</p>
